      <h1>Elm Metrics</h1>
      <p>Hi! I'm Vince. I'm the general counsel at UpGuard, a B2B cybersecurity company. I was previously associate general counsel at Coursera (NYSE: COUR) where I led several teams, including the B2B SaaS contracting team pre- and post-IPO.</p>
      <p>I love metrics and legal operations. I'm certain that being data oriented is a key part of creating a highly-effective, empathetic in-house legal team. To that end, I'm working on writing up and sharing the "what", "why", and "how" of metrics that have been helpful to me. I hope they are helpful to you too.</p>
